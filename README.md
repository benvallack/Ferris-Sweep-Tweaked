# Tweaked Sweep Compact

![Screenshot 2022-02-12 180505](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27895007/153721097-bd672043-a2b1-445c-9fe2-a1f0b4dc29a5.jpg)

A custom version of the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

This version has a tightenend up edge cut and spider web silkscreen. See [my video](https://youtu.be/JqpBKuEVinw) for how to customise these.

## Notes:

+ This version is based on the sweep compact. As such, the two micro-controllers must be installed as pictured above (one facing up, the other facing down).
    - To avoid this, follow the video instuctions but use the sweep-half-swept as your starting point.
+ New editions of the sweep and some minor updates have been made since this version was made. This version is still functional, but it's recommended to follow the video instructions starting from a more updated base.
